# CodeBurst

CodeBurst is an interactive code revision and practice platform that helps learners strengthen programming concepts through hands-on coding tasks. It combines real-time code execution, and progress tracking — making coding practice consistent, engaging, and productive. Instead of reading theory, users revise programming concepts by writing and executing small, focused coding tasks such as printing outputs, working with arrays, and solving logical challenges.
